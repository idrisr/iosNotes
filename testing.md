## Mock

* concerned with standing in for a (possibly expensive) real object,
* providing no-op answers for all method calls. 
* can count how often specific mock methods with certain parameters have been called during a test.

## Stub

* concerned with simulating specific behaviour. 

## Spy

* wraps a real object 
* and by default routes all method calls to the original object, 
* also passing through the original results. 
* Method call counting also works for spies. 

## Quick

* describe
* context
* it

## BDD
