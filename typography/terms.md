# Spacing

## Leading
* manipulate the spacing between characters
* spacing between the baselines of type.
* useful way of saving or using space on a page.

## Kerning
* manipulate the spacing between characters
* spacing in between individual characters. 
* Most fonts will have specific default kerning for individual character sets so that the spacing in between the letters in words feels more natural.


## Tracking
* space between groups of letters rather than individual letters
* affects the overall character density of the copy
* help to eliminate widows and orphans in paragraphs.  
* Widows are when the final line of a paragraph begins a new column or page.
* Orphans are when paragraphs end in single words, part of words or a short phrase that seems out of place.
