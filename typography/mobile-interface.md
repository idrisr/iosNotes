# type

* hierarchy
* different * distinguishable
* emphasis
* size
* weight
* color
* case

## SF Display
*  for large font sizes
* 9 weights
* larger type, more details

## SF Text
*  for small 
* 6 weights
* small type, so at small sizes the weights are meaningless
* more letter spacing, ie tracking

* capital letters need more spacing than lower case
