# Send Grid

## white label
Domain whitelabeling adds an `SPF` (Sender Policy Framework) record to your
domain and `DKIM` (DomainKeys Identified Mail) entries, which effectively
authorizes and authenticates SendGrid to send on behalf of your domain. This
is the best way to get rid of the "sent on behalf of" or "via" message that
some email providers display.

Whitelabeling adds a `CNAME` record for a subdomain that you choose, which
masks click and open-tracking links to your domain, rather than a SendGrid
domain. This increases deliverability, builds trust, and strengthens your
brand in your emails.
