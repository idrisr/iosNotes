### Artboards
from [here](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/grouping/artboards/)

Artboards allow you to create fixed frames on Sketch’s infinite Canvas, but they’re completely optional.

### Resizing Constraints
from [here](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/layer-basics/constraints/)

Applying constraints to layers allows you to determine how they should behave when you resize the Symbol, Artboard, or group those layers are in.


### slice
type of layer that you can draw over an area in the Canvas that will export the content within as an image.
