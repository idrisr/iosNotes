# Gemfile

[readme](https://tosbourn.com/what-is-the-gemfile/)

* a file we create which is used for describing `gem` dependencies
for Ruby programs. 
* A `gem` is a collection of Ruby code that we can extract
into a “collection” which we can call later.

* should always be in the root of your project directory
* this is where `Bundler` expects it to be and it is the standard place for any
package manager style files to live.
