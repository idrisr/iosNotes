# CoreMedia

* framework responsible for handling sample processing, synchronization, queues, and time representation in AVFoundation.

Core Media is part of the low-level media pipeline used by AV Foundation. It
provides the low-level data types and interfaces needed for working with
audio samples and video frames. Core Media additionally provides the timing
model used by AV Foundation based around the CMTime data type. CMTime, and
its associated data types, are used when working with time-based operations
in AV Foundation.
